SquareOne
=========

Integration of multimedia descriptions of football matches (parsing MPEG video and text) - written in 2000 for my BSc - so BEWARE, depreciation city!

Identifies frame-breaks in video and different types of motion. Detects (crudely) pitches and goal-posts. Parses sports reports for timed events.
